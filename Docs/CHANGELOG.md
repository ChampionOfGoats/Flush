# Changelog

## v0.3

Added ASP.NET Core Identity 3 support. Flush configures ASP.NET Core Identity 3 with an encrypted sqlite backing store.

Added JWT Bearer based authentication.

Added support for session reconnection.

Moved to an in-memory SignalR user/group model. This is faster than the existing sqlite backing store, and identity now tracks much of what we were originally tracking.

Added XML documentation to all classes.

Fixed an issue involving scoped use of AuthenticationProvider in AutomaticLogoutProvider.

### v0.3.2

Add bootstrapping scripts.

Update Dockerfile to support bootstrapping scripts and new tooling.

### v0.3.3

Reinstate room autofill function.

### v0.3.4

Fixed an issue that could cause capitalisation to result in unique rooms.

Fixed an issue that could cause usernames to be claimed globally, rather than per room.

## v0.2

Improved disconnection handling.

Improved keep-alive/ttl.

## v0.1

Initial version.
